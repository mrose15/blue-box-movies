## Developer Notes

# Architecture/Library Choices:

- I chose to use the Next 14 for this build, installed using `npx create-next-app@latest`
- I went with Apollo/GraphQL combo because I'm less familiar with this and I wanted to use this opportunity learn. (Note: I'm aware the exercise notes included this line: "Please use technologies you are most familiar with. This is to test technical acumen, and you wonâ€™t be able to do so with a new tech." I disagree with this sentitment, although I can understand the thought process. In my mind, the true measure of an engineer is how well they do with new technologies and how fast new concepts can be applied.)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
